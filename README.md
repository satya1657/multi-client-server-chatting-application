step-1 :- Run the MyServer.java file (it will give you a frame of server, there is a textfield in this frame, which will give you status about your users who are login )

Step-2:- how many user you want to connect with server, run UserLogIn.java file that much time - (this give you a frame to logIn enter any name in ID field you want but do not use same name more than one time)

step-3:- Now user are ready to talk with each other.

Very Imp: if you are running on ubuntu (or a plateform where you can not put all java file in same package), then you will have to run MyServer.java then loninMyClient.java only, because --> loginMyClient = UserLogIn.java + MyClient.java

NOTE : if your code is showing any error message about port number or connection reset then you will have to chane your port number and this port number can be between 2000 to 9999

NOTE : do not try to run MyClient.java file (Because it is automatically invoked by UserLogIn.java file)
